% Rule: The sum from 1 to 1 is 1. (Base case)
sum_to_n(1, 1).

% Rule: The sum from 1 to N is (N + Sum from 1 to N-1). (Recursive step)
sum_to_n(N, Sum) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum_to_n(N1, SubSum),
    Sum is N + SubSum.

% To run a query in your Prolog interpreter:
% ?- sum_to_n(10, Total).
% Expected output: Total = 55.
