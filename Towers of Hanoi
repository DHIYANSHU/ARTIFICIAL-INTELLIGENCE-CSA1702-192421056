% move(N, Source, Auxiliary, Target)
% Base case: Move 1 disk from Source to Target.
hanoi(1, Source, _, Target) :-

% Recursive step
hanoi(N, Source, Auxiliary, Target) :-
    N > 1,
    % 1. Move N-1 disks from Source to Auxiliary.
    N1 is N - 1,

    % 2. Move the Nth disk from Source to Target.
    write('Move disk '), write(N), write(' from '), write(Source), write(' to '), write(Target), nl,
    % 3. Move N-1 disks from Auxiliary to Target.
    hanoi(N1, Auxiliary, Source, Target).

% To run a query:
% ?- hanoi(3, 'A', 'B', 'C').
